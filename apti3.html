            <p><strong>Directions for Questions 16 to 20:</strong> The passage given below is followed by a set of five   questions. Choose the most appropriate answer to each   question.</p>
            <p>To summarize   the Classic Maya collapse, we can tentatively identify five strands. I   acknowledge, however, that Maya archaeologists still disagree vigorously among   themselves&mdash;in part, because the different strands evidently varied in importance   among different parts of the Maya realm; because detailed archaeological studies   are available for only some Maya sites; and because it remains puzzling why most   of the Maya heartland remained nearly empty of population and failed to recover   after the collapse and after re-growth of forests.<br />
                <br />
              With those caveats, it   appears to me that one strand consisted of population growth outstripping   available resources: a dilemma similar to the one foreseen by Thomas Malthus in   1798 and being played out today in Rwanda (Chapter 10), Haiti (Chapter 11), and   elsewhere. As the archaeologist David Webster succinctly puts it, &ldquo;Too many   farmers grew too many crops on too much of the landscape.&rdquo; Compounding that   mismatch between population and resources was the second strand: the effects of   deforestation and hillside erosion, which caused a decrease in the amount of   useable farmland at a time when more rather than less farmland was needed, and   possibly exacerbated by an anthropogenic drought resulting from deforestation,   by soil nutrient depletion and other soil problems, and by the struggle to   prevent bracken ferns from overrunning the fields.<br />
              <br />
              The third strand   consisted of increased fighting, as more and more people fought over fewer   resources. Maya warfare, already endemic, peaked just before the collapse. That   is not surprising when one reflects that at least 5,000,000 people, perhaps many   more, were crammed into an area smaller than the state of Colorado (104,000   square miles). That warfare would have decreased further the amount of land   available for agriculture, by creating no-man&rsquo;s lands between principalities   where it was now unsafe to farm. Bringing matters to a head was the strand of   climate change. The drought at the time of the Classic collapse was not the   first drought that the Maya had lived through, but it was the most severe. At   the time of previous droughts, there were still uninhabited parts of the Maya   landscape, and people at a site affected by drought could save themselves by   moving to another site. However, by the time of the Classic collapse the   landscape was now full, there was no useful unoccupied land in the vicinity on   which to begin anew, and the whole population could not be accommodated in the   few areas that continued to have reliable water supplies.<br />
              <br />
              As our fifth   strand, we have to wonder why the kings and nobles failed to recognize and solve   these seemingly obvious problems undermining their society. Their attention was   evidently focused on their short-term concerns of enriching themselves, waging   wars, erecting monuments, competing with each other, and extracting enough food   from the peasants to support all those activities. Like most leaders throughout   human history, the Maya kings and nobles did not heed long-term problems,   insofar as they perceived them. We shall return to this theme in Chapter   14.<br />
              <br />
              Finally, while we still have some other past societies to consider in   this book before we switch our attention to the modern world, we must already be   struck by some parallels between the Maya and the past societies discussed in   Chapters 2-4. As on Easter Island, Mangareva, and among the Anasazi, Maya   environmental and population problems led to increasing warfare and civil   strife. As on Easter Island and at Chaco Canyon, Maya peak population numbers   were followed swiftly by political and social collapse. Paralleling the eventual   extension of agriculture from Easter Island&rsquo;s coastal lowlands to its uplands,   and from the Mimbres floodplain to the hills, Copan&rsquo;s inhabitants also expanded   from the floodplain to the more fragile hill slopes, leaving them with a larger   population to feed when the agricultural boom in the hills went bust. Like   Easter Island chiefs erecting ever larger statues, eventually crowned by pukao,   and like Anasazi elite treating themselves to necklaces of 2,000 turquoise   beads, Maya kings sought to outdo each other with more and more impressive   temples, covered with thicker and thicker plaster&mdash; reminiscent in turn of the   extravagant conspicuous consumption by modern American CEOs. The passivity of   Easter chiefs and Maya kings in the face of the real big threats to their   societies completes our list of disquieting parallels.</p>
